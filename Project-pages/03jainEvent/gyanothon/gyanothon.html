        <h1>Gyanothon</h1>
        <p><strong>Gyanothon</strong> is an innovative IoT-based game that combines physical exercise with interactive learning. In this game, the player rides a physical exercise bike. As they cycle, a character in the game also begins to cycle. The player can track their progress on the mini-map located at the top-right corner of the screen.</p>
    
    <p>At certain points in the game, the player will be asked questions. These points are shown on the mini-map, and when the player reaches them, they need to answer the question. The answer can be given by pressing the green or red button mounted on the exercise bike, where the green button represents the correct answer and the red button represents the wrong answer.</p>
    
    <h2>Benefits of the Project:</h2>

        <li><strong>Interactive Learning:</strong> Players learn new things by answering questions while cycling, blending exercise with knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> The integration of a game character and mini-map keeps the player engaged and motivated to continue cycling.</li>
